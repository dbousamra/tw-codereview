## Overview:
Some ideas and thoughts around what we can do to improve the ThoughtWorks interview-candidate code review process.

### Problems:

- Not a huge amount of visibility around whether there is code needing to be reviewed.

2. I log onto http://codereview.thoughtworks.com with my CAS credentials.
3. I see all open candidates (
